# 📘 Respellion Employee Handbook

Welcome! This repository contains the source for our public **Employee Handbook**, built as a clean, modern, and easy-to-navigate documentation site.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

We keep things simple and containerized:

- **Static site generator**: [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- **Theme**: [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) (via the official Docker image)
- **Container runtime**: Docker or Podman
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose
- **Deployment**: Ansible
- **Web server**: [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) (as a reverse proxy)

---

## 🧰 Requirements

To run or contribute to this project locally, you’ll need:

- A working internet connection  
- Git  
- An OCI-compatible container runtime (e.g., **Docker** or **Podman**)  
- *(Optional)* A web browser to preview the site  

> 💡 The entire app is containerized—no Python or MkDocs installation needed on your host!

---

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 1. Preview the Site Locally

Run this command to start a live-reloading development server:

```bash
podman run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs:z squidfunk/mkdocs-material serve --dev-addr 0.0.0.0:8000
```

or if you have Docker installed:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs:z squidfunk/mkdocs-material serve --dev-addr 0.0.0.0:8000
```



> 🔍 **Note**: We bind to `0.0.0.0` so the site is accessible outside the container (e.g., from your browser).  
> If port `8000` is busy, change it (e.g., `-p 8080:8000`).

Then open your browser to: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

or if you have Docker installed and are using VS Code press **F5**, that will start the container and website.

> 🔍 **Note**: For VS Code we use the port from the settings.json.
> If port `8000` is busy, change  "mkdocs.port": 8080.

Edit any Markdown file in the `docs/` folder—changes appear instantly!

### 2. Starting a New MkDocs Project (Optional)

If you ever want to spin up a fresh MkDocs site from scratch:

```bash
podman run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/docs:z squidfunk/mkdocs-material new .
```

This creates the basic `mkdocs.yml` and `docs/` structure.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We welcome improvements! Just:

1. Fork the repo  
2. Make your changes  
3. Open a **Pull Request**  

All updates to the handbook go through PRs—no direct pushes to `master`.

---

## 🚀 Deploying the Site

Deployment is fully automated with Ansible. Make sure to install the Ansible collections and roles before starting with:

```
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

And to deploy to staging:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini ./deploy_playbook.yml
```

Deploying directly to prod:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini ./deploy_playbook.yml -e env=prod
```

> ✅ Make sure you have SSH access to the target host listed in `hosts.ini`.

### What the playbook does:

1. Installs Docker (if missing)  
2. Copies the entire project to `/opt/mkdocs` on the remote host  
3. Runs `docker compose up -d` to start the site  

That’s it! The live site is served via Caddy as a reverse proxy.

---

## Creating infra

There is an extra playbook to deploy the infra, 'deploy_infra_playbook.yml'. It is deployed in the same way. It deploys and starts a Caddy container with the Caddyfile to reverse proxy to all the environments. (staging and prod.) This is seperated from the rest of the application, because we don't need to redeploy the infra part with every release. Also the Let's Encrypt authority is rate-limited by 5 certificate requests per 7 days. 

Deploy the infra with:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini ./deploy_infra_playbook.yml 
```
