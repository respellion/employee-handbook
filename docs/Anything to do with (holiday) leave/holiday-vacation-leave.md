# Holiday and vacation leave

## Leave procedure

When you take leave, you’ll, of course, have a critical look at your calendar and your colleagues and make sure that your colleagues know that you are not there before you take leave. The administration is done in "Shifts" within Microsoft Teams. 

 

Make a new Request for Time-Off in Microsoft Shifts with the right category. This also includes Sick Leave. 

Your request will be approved by the People Officer after which the leave will be visible in Shifts to the whole team. 

 

Create an event in your own calendar for your holiday to ensure your agenda is blocked. 

 

If you are not sure whether your leave falls under holiday hours but, for example, under care or a sudden absence, please contact the People Officer role, so together we can have a look at the possibilities. Also take a look on the paragraph 📆 Sick Leave and 📆Special Leave, for more info.  


## Leave administration in Exact

**1. Basic Principles**  
<!-- Blank -->
**-Time sheets are for Productive Hours:** In the time sheet administration, you only register productive hours. These include hours for clients, internal projects, work meetings, or business development. Absences such as leave should not be registered here.  
**-Leave Administration for Absences:** All forms of absence, such as regular leave, special leave, and time-for-time, are registered via the leave registration module in Exact.  
**-Time-for-Time (TfT):** If you work more hours than your contract stipulates in a month, these extra hours will be added to your TfT balance at the beginning of the following month.  
<!-- Blank -->

## Vacation leave

If you work full-time, you are entitled to 25 vacation days. Of these, 20 are statutory, and 5 are non-statutory.

If you work part-time, this will be calculated based on the amount of time you work. The same applies when you start or stop employment mid-year. 

We think it’s important to chill for a considerable amount of time during the year. And when we say this, we really mean relax and not think about work. That’s why you must take two consecutive working weeks of vacation a year.

 
## How to take (annual) leave

You need to apply for leave in advance. This is done in "Shifts" within Microsoft Teams. Coordinate within your circle who is on holiday and when, and make sure that the important things or certain tasks are transferred to your colleagues during the time when you're on vacation.

 

When you become ill unexpectedly during your vacation, you will keep your vacation days. Read more in the paragraph about illness.

 
## Vacation days that have not been used

If the situation occurs that by the end of the year you haven’t used up your full vacation hours, then you can bring 80 hours of leave (working on a full-time base) to the new year. The statutory days will expire 6 months after the calendar year in which you've accrued them. For example, the vacation days that you received in 2024 but did not use will expire on July 1st 2025.

 

    An exception can be made if you were chronically ill.

    Non-statutory supplementary days expire after 5 years.

     

We find it important that you get days off, therefore it is not intended to save up leave time. That is why we don’t pay in exchange for days off.

 

An upper and lower limit of the leave balance is set on January 1st of each year. On January 1st of each year, a negative balance of one week of contracting hours is permitted. On January 1st of each year, the number of extra non-statutory vacation hours may not exceed twice the amount of contracting hours per week. When the minimum or maximum is reached, taking or saving hours of leave is only permitted again after leave hours have been added to or taken from the balance.

 

In the case of leave exceeding the upper limit at the end of the calendar year, agreements will be made to reduce the credit as soon as possible.

 
## Holidays

On the following days, you can write a cross in your calendar. You get a day off on:
<!-- Blank -->
o New Year’s Day (January 1st)  
o Easter Monday  
o King’s day (April 27)  
o Liberation Day in the anniversary year (May 5th 2025/2030)  
o Ascension Day  
o Whit Monday  
o Both Christmas Days (December 25th and 26)  
<!-- Blank -->


     

You may also leave a bit earlier (one hour earlier) on
<!-- Blank -->
o Good Friday  
o 5th of May on the non-lustrum years  
o the day before Christmas  
o New Year's Eve  
<!-- Blank -->
     

This is a small compensation for those who are working these special days. So taking the day off will cost you the normal 8 hours. There is no extra compensation for public holiday leave that falls on your standard schedule-free day in case of part time employment.

 

The days of public holidays are by default greyed out in Exact.  However, you do need to register holiday leave on this day and if, in any case, you need to work on these days you can register these hours on your project.  

## Interchangeable Holiday policy

We want to be an inclusive organization, so we have the Interchangeable Holiday Policy. With this policy, you may exchange 4 national Dutch holidays per year for any other day of your choice. By doing this, we hope to offer a more inclusive arrangement for colleagues who, for example, but not limited to, prefer to celebrate Eid al-Fitr (also referred to in the Netherlands as Suikerfeest), Thanksgiving, Yom Kippur, your birthday or Christmas Eve.

 

If you want to take another day off instead of the regular public holidays, you request a day of leave with “verlofsoort” FEESTDAG.
