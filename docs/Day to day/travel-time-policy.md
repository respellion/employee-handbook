# Travel Time Policy

At Respellion, we recognize that business travel is sometimes necessary to serve our clients effectively. This policy outlines how travel time is compensated, ensuring a fair balance between business needs and personal time. The following guidelines have been established to provide clarity on travel time compensation for all employees.

- Employees may claim travel time that exceeds 1.5 hours (one-way).
- For any single journey, the first 1.5 hours of travel time (one-way) is considered personal time and will not be compensated.
- Any travel time beyond 1.5 hours per single journey can be registered and will be compensated at a 1:1 ratio.
- This policy applies to occasional travel requirements. For structural travel patterns that consistently exceed this threshold, individual arrangements may be discussed.
- Employees should register travel time using the appropriate hour type in the time registration system..
