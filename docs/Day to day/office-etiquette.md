# Office Etiquette

At Respellion, we strive for a productive and respectful work environment for everyone, including during remote meetings held from the office. To minimize disruptions and ensure optimal concentration, the following guidelines apply:

 

- **Larger meetings and demonstrations:** For meetings with multiple participants or for demonstrations, it is essential to reserve a separate meeting room. This ensures that others in the open-plan office are not disturbed and that meeting participants can concentrate optimally.

- **Individual calls and short discussions:** Brief, individual calls or quick discussions via a remote connection are acceptable in the open office space. However, always be mindful of your volume and try to cause as little inconvenience as possible to your colleagues. Keep the duration of such calls in the open space limited.

     

These guidelines contribute to our collective well-being and efficient way of working, in line with our core values such as trust and self-discipline, which are also reflected in our ability to be considerate of one another.
