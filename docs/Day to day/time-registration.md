# Exact Time Registration

We use Exact online as financial administration and for time registration in projects, internal activities and absence. 

 

In the following instruction you can find the steps that you need to do, to register your hours on the various types.

 

You need to register all contract hours, so if you work 36 hours, you register only 36 hours. 
 

- Time registration on Time and Material (TM): Instruction
- Time registration on Fixed Price Projects (FPP): Instruction

     

- Absence registration: Instruction
- NB: please be sure that you **do not** register hours of absence in your time registration. This will double your registered hours, you can leave these empty in your daily or weekly registration.

     

- Time that you spend on internal activities needs to be specified on the correct “Uursoort” in project **INTBD001 - Business Development**
- NB: Time that we spend on the Werk en Rol overleg have a specific uursoort.

 

## Sickness registration

When you are sick, you do not need to register any hours in Exact yourself.
You must report your sickness to the people officer role, according to the procedure in our absence protocol. The poeple officer will then ensure your sick leave is registered correctly in Exact.
