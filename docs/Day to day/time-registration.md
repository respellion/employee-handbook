You need to register all contract hours, so if you work 36 hours, you register only 36 hours.

## Sickness registration

When you are ill, you do not need to register any hours in Exact yourself.
Do report your illness to the people officer role, according to the procedure in our absence protocol. The people officer will then ensure your sick leave is registered correctly in Exact.
