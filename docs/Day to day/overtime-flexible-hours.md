# Overtime and Flexible Hours

At Respellion, we strive for a sustainable and healthy work-life balance. This aligns directly with our core value of Self-Discipline. We trust that as a professional, you take personal responsibility for maintaining healthy working hours. These guidelines provide a framework to facilitate flexibility, protect you, and simultaneously offer the autonomy that fits our culture. In exceptional cases, there is always the opportunity to discuss possibilities.
1. Framework for flexibility and saving hours (Employee's Choice)

We understand that you may need flexibility. Therefore, it is possible to manage your contract hours flexibly within a month or to work extra hours to save for time off at a later moment. There is no obligation to use these saved hours within a specific period.

 

    Time-for-time as the basis: Hours you work beyond the daily norm are automatically processed as saved leave hours. These hours are compensated on a 1-for-1 basis (100%) on weekdays.
    Savings Maximum: To maintain balance, there is a maximum of 24 hours above the normal non-statutory balance.
    Personal Responsibility: It is your responsibility to monitor your saved hours balance and to take your time off promptly to avoid exceeding the 24-hour limit. This is a direct example of the self-discipline we value highly at Respellion.

Administration

Time-for-Time (TfT): If you work more hours than your contract stipulates in a month, these extra hours will be added to your TfT balance at the beginning of the following month.

 

    Accrual: At the beginning of each month, the overtime hours from the previous month are manually added to your TfT balance. You will see this as a separate balance in your leave administration.

    Taking Leave:

        Go to Leave Registration in Exact.

        Click on "Create leave registration".

        Select your own name.

        Under Leave Type, choose "Tijd-voor-tijd" (Time-for-time).

        Enter the number of hours you wish to take.

        Please note: Ensure you do not create a negative TfT balance.

2. Overtime by Assignment (Client Necessity)

While our policy is aimed at preventing overtime, it may occur that a client requests extra effort. In such cases, the following framework applies:

    Consultation is crucial: Overtime at a client's request always takes place in consultation and approval with the responsible role. We will take your personal situation into account as much as possible.
    Compensation:
        Overtime on weekdays is standardly compensated with time-for-time (100%).
        For necessary work on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays, significantly higher compensation rates apply: 175% for weekend days and 300% for public holidays. These hours are also primarily compensated in time.

3. Payout of Saved Hours

We offer the option to have saved hours paid out. It is your own responsibility to indicate in a timely manner if you wish to have saved hours paid out. This aligns with the entrepreneurial attitude we encourage in all our colleagues.
