# Our core values and manifest

## Our core values

We have four core values which form the basis for our organization, the cooperation, and the behavior we strive for. In our application process, we will find out together how these values are expressed in you.

 
**1 - Trust**

We give trust by allowing room for autonomy. We trust another and are open and transparent. That’s why we talk with another instead of about the other person. We have faith in someone else’s intentions, assume the right and express that trust. Everyone can rely on each other, and we stand for results.

 
**2 - Courage**

We have courage and dare to deviate from the traditional way of working when we see things we can improve. It’s okay to make mistakes. In this way, we learn to do (even) better. We dare to make ourselves vulnerable and welcome feedback. We like to do things differently. That makes us a bit rebellious, but we always have good reasoning.

 
**3 - Self-discipline**

We make clear agreements and honour them. We take responsibility for our activities and set clear priorities. We have the discipline to develop ourselves and want to be the best in our field. Trust requires self-control and the courage to take a step beyond your own ego.

 
**4 - Entrepreneurship**

We are committed and driven entrepreneurs who think in terms of opportunities and possibilities. For our environment and for ourselves. Because things will change, we are flexible and critical. When we tackle something, we do it with both hands and we feel responsible for the result.

 
**Repellion manifest**

Our values are ultimately expressed in behaviour, which is why we have formulated four statements that our customers can hold us accountable for. "Practice what you preach" is very important to us.

 
**We are always in motion to be agile**

Society is a system of networks that is always in motion. Success comes from the ability to adapt. Adapting is needed on an organizational and individual level. We want to keep learning and align what we do with each other and society.

 
**Collaboration based on a common interest**

We believe in cooperation as it is needed in a society. Dealing with each other as you do in a village or neighbourhood. Here reliability is a great asset, with attention to the interests of others.

Our vision is that there is no individual interest that takes precedence over the collective interest. This requires self-insight and awareness of our values, beliefs and behaviour. That insight is necessary to ensure that we choose the collective instead of following our ego.

 
**Working with a smile and a caring attitude**

There is no “ladder of success” in our organization. We have a responsibility to take care of each other rather than pursue individual interests. We are a collective of professional, skilled people. We hold each other accountable for this responsibility with a caring attitude, which leads to better cooperation and therefore high-quality services. As a result, we practice what we preach and are congruent in our behaviour.

 
**Our organisation strives for a balance between people, planet and profit**

We are convinced that sustainable solutions are only possible if attention is paid to the balance between people, planet and profit. We don’t think in terms of us and them. Long-term results always outweigh short-term interests. The open-source model fits in seamlessly with this vision.

 
**Respellion Operating System**

We have knowledge and experience in successfully executing result-driven projects and how to empower people in high-performing teams. Autonomy and craftsmanship are central in our daily activities.

 
**Agile way of thinking and dynamic structure**

We work with organic, flat structured teams. We don’t have managers: employees take the initiative and responsibility for the autonomy in their work. Meaning that they choose the roles that they are good at and motivates them.

 

In our culture, employees trust each other, demonstrate courage and discipline, and embrace an entrepreneurial mindset.
