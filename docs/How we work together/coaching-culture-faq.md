# Coaching Culture FAQ

## 1. What does the coaching culture at Respellion entail and how did this concept come about?

The coaching culture at Respellion is the concept in which employees regularly give each other feedback, support and guidance with the aim of continuous improvement and collaboration. This concept has evolved from an initial 'feedback culture' to a more comprehensive approach to coaching, focusing on employee development. It is intended as an alternative to traditional performance management systems.

## 2. What are 'huddle check-ins' and 'huddle elevators' and what is their purpose within the organization?

Respellion implements weekly 'huddle check-ins' (once a week), which are small group meetings where team members can share updates and concerns and support each other. The goal is to create a mentor-like environment within small, trusted groups for more frequent and meaningful interactions than traditional mentoring programs. In addition, there are monthly 'huddle lifts', which are more in-depth sessions focused on personal and professional development. These 'lift' sessions are designed to strengthen individuals in their strengths and serve as a platform for coaching conversations, requiring inputs such as personal development plans and competency insights.

## 3. What is Respellion's capacity building framework and what three main areas does it cover?

Respellion's capacity building framework focuses on the holistic development of employees and includes three main areas: professional capacity (intellectual and work-related skills), emotional capacity (social skills, self-reflection, alignment of personal values with work, inclusivity and diversity), and physical capacity (encouragement of healthy lifestyles). The goal is to create balanced and satisfied employees who can be fully themselves at work.

## 4. What is a personal development plan within Respellion and how is Ofman's Core Quadrant model used?

Every employee at Respellion draws up a personal development plan, based on the capacity building framework. A fundamental part of this is identifying core qualities using Ofman's Core Quadrant model. This model helps employees understand their strengths (core qualities), pitfalls, challenges, and allergies (what irritates them in others). The plan is visualized on a Miro board for easy updating and sharing during the "elevator" sessions.

## 5. How does Respellion's coaching culture relate to concepts such as holacracy and traditional performance management?

The coaching culture is intended to replace traditional performance management, in which assessment and reward are central, with a more continuous, collaborative and development-oriented approach. While there may be parallels with elements from Holacracy, such as working in smaller groups (huddles), Holacracy focuses primarily on the organizational structure and decision-making, while Respellion's coaching culture focuses specifically on personal and professional development and feedback mechanisms within the organization. It is recognized that effective implementation of the huddles may require some form of 'huddle lead' or facilitator, which introduces an element of leadership within the self-organizing teams.

## 6. What role does openness and vulnerability play in the coaching culture and how is this stimulated?

Openness and vulnerability are seen as essential elements for the success of the coaching culture. Employees are encouraged to be open about their development points and to be vulnerable, so that colleagues can better support them and help them to empower them. The 'elevator' sessions and sharing of personal development plans on the Miro board are designed to create a safe environment for this candor. Questioning core qualities in different relationships and reflecting on them in the group also contribute to self-insight and an open dialogue.
