# Circles, Huddles and Celebrations

At Respellion, we've evolved beyond traditional performance management to embrace a coaching culture where continuous improvement and collaboration thrive. Our structure is designed to foster regular feedback, support, and guidance among all team members.

## Key Components:

**Huddle Check-ins:** These weekly small group meetings create a supportive environment where team members can share updates, discuss concerns, and offer mutual support. Unlike traditional mentorship programs, these frequent check-ins ensure meaningful connections within trusted groups.

**Huddle Elevators:** These two monthly in-depth sessions focus on personal and professional development. The "elevator" concept emphasizes building on your strengths rather than just addressing weaknesses. These sessions incorporate your Personal Development Plan (POP) and competency insights to guide meaningful coaching conversations.

## Capacity Building Framework

Our approach to development encompasses three key areas:

- **Professional Capacity:** Enhancing your work-related skills and intellectual abilities
- **Emotional Capacity:** Developing social skills, self-reflection, and aligning personal values with work
- **Physical Capacity:** Supporting healthy lifestyle choices 

 

The Personal Development Plan (POP) you'll create uses Ofman's Core Quadrant model to identify your core qualities, potential pitfalls, challenges, and areas of growth. This holistic approach helps you bring your authentic self to work and contribute to our collaborative environment.
