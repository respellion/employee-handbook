# What does Respellion actually do?

## We develop and maintain software

Respellion is an organization that has knowledge and experience about technology and organization. We have a clear vision of how digitization can best be technically developed and managed but also how this can be organized in an efficient way. This combination is exceptionally powerful and leads to successful solutions.

 

Our services focus on result-driven projects, high performance teams and consultancy.

 
## Projects

Based on years of experience with developing software in multiple organizations, we know how to organize this effectively in an Agile manner and how to execute it in a result-driven way.

Our methodology ensures that we stay in control of progress and budget, both in the development and maintenance phase. Our developers endorse the Agile Manifesto as a starting point for daily activities. This provides a basis for big and small decision-making. By using metrics, we know at any time where we stand and what is needed to achieve the final goal.

We are able to scale up and down in a timely manner with the right expertise needed, such as developers, architects, testers, analysts, UX designers and DevOps engineers.

 
## High performance teams

We deliver high performance teams. In our vision, these are teams of IT professionals with in-depth technical knowledge, who bring the DNA of our organization. The core values of courage, self-discipline, responsibility, and entrepreneurship ensure a way of working together that creates synergy between individual competences.

Team members are highly trained T-shaped professionals who perform all the work necessary to deliver results. By attending training courses, conferences and workshops, they stay up-to-date with the latest developments in their field of expertise. In addition, our agile coaches stimulate new insights and awareness, so that there is attention to the wellbeing of the individual.

For us, high performance also means working closely with our customers and striving for continuous improvement. We continuously evaluate our performance, learn from successes, but also failures, and adapt processes to get better and better.

 
## Consultancy

We have thought leaders who help organizations with strategic challenges and advice, perform technical analysis, develop tailor-made solutions, and support organizations in making IT decisions.

We specialize in IT architecture, software development, information security, quality assurance, agile management and coaching. Our services consist of interim deployment, but also of result-driven or individual assignments.
