# Spending and purchasing

## General Principles

The goal of our spending and purchasing policies is to enable roles to be fully accountable for the work they do including spending.

 
We trust our team members to make sensible decisions about company expenses. This policy provides guidelines to ensure clarity and compliance with Dutch tax regulations. For more details about the Dutch Tax regulations and the werkkostenregeling (WKR) see: Werkkostenregeling (WKR)

## Basic Rules

1. Spend company money as if it were your own
1. Recurring items are monitored
1. Submit expenses within 30 days
1. Always upload clear photos of original receipts in our Expense App
1. Choose the right “Type/Soort” and the right "Description/Beschrijving"
