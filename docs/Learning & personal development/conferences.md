# Overview
Respellion encourages professional development through conference attendance. Each employee is entitled to approximately 40 hours per year for attending conferences.  

## How to register

All available conferences are listed in the SharePoint Events Calendar. 
You can filter the view to see only tech conferences.

### Express Your Interest
Indicate your interest by adding your name to the "interest list" in the calendar.
Regular reminders will be sent about upcoming conferences.
