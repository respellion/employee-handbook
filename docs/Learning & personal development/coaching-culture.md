# Coaching Culture

At Respellion, we've evolved beyond traditional performance management to embrace a coaching culture where continuous improvement and collaboration thrive. Our structure is designed to foster regular feedback, support, and guidance among all team members.


## Key Components

**Huddle Check-ins:** These twice-weekly small group meetings create a supportive environment where team members can share updates, discuss concerns, and offer mutual support. Unlike traditional mentorship programs, these frequent check-ins ensure meaningful connections within trusted groups.

**Huddle Elevator:** These monthly in-depth sessions focus on personal and professional development. The "lift" concept emphasizes building on your strengths rather than just addressing weaknesses. These sessions incorporate your Personal Development Plan (POP) and competency insights to guide meaningful coaching conversations.

 

**The Personal Development Plan (POP)** you'll create uses Ofman's Core Quadrant model to identify your core qualities, potential pitfalls, challenges, and areas of growth. This holistic approach helps you bring your authentic self to work and contribute to our collaborative environment.


## Capacity Building Framework

Our approach to development encompasses three key areas:

 

- **Intellectual Capacity:** This involves continuous learning, critical thinking, and mastering new skills. For teams, it's about encouraging curiosity, problem-solving, and developing the collective knowledge base.

     

- **Physical Capacity:** While individually about health and energy management, for teams this translates to creating sustainable work practices, preventing burnout, and establishing routines that enhance productivity.

     

- **Emotional Capacity:** This encompasses self-awareness, empathy, and resilience. In teams, it involves building psychological safety, effective communication, and the ability to navigate challenges together.

     
- **Spiritual Capacity:** This focuses on understanding your core values and purpose. For teams, it means creating a clear sense of direction, aligning with shared values, and ensuring everyone understands the "why" behind their work.
