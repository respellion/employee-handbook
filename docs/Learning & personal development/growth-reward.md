# Growth & Reward

At Respellion, we believe in a fair reward structure that is as transparent and enterprising as our way of working. This also means that the model can be adapted if there is a reason to do so. We move away from rigid job scales and instead focus on your actual added value.


## The 5 Pillars of Value

Your impact—and therefore your potential salary growth—is measured based on five core pillars. These form the foundation of your development and evaluation. It is important to note that these pillars are weighted differently, which determines your final increase category; not every element carries the same weight in the final score.

The pillars and their specific weighting are as follows:

- A. **Basic Experience & Expertise (Weighting: 100%):** Your fundamental professional knowledge and skills.

- B. **Role Fulfilment & Responsibility (Weighting: 75%):** How much ownership do you show in your Holacratic roles?

- C. **Impact & Results (Weighting: 80%):** The tangible value you deliver for clients and our purpose.

- D. **Development & Learning Curve (Weighting: 100%):** Your growth on intellectual, emotional and physical levels (linked to your Personal Development Plan).

- E. **Culture & Collaboration (Weighting: 80%):** Your contribution to the team, living our values, and 'working with a smile'.

## From Evaluation to Reward

Your salary increase is not a predetermined fact based on years of service, but a reflection of your performance over the past year.

## Step 1: Self-Evaluation

You assess yourself on the five pillars above; this forms your performance score. Your colleagues will directly challenge you to ensure a complete and honest self-assessment. This feedback takes place multiple times a year during the Huddle Elevator sessions.

## Step 2: Salary Increase

The determined performance score is linked to a linear model of increase percentages.

We use several bands, e.g., 0–2%, 2–4%, etc. The higher the performance score, the higher the salary increase. This ensures that above-average performance is rewarded above average, rather than a standard 'automatic' increase for everyone.

When determining the bands, we consider factors such as:

- **Financial health:** We analyse the total increase in wage costs in relation to our turnover and margins. We want to remain a healthy company; steep increases must be covered by our rates and results.

- **Inflation (CPI):** We look at the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of the past year to protect purchasing power.

- **Market conformity:** We compare our salaries with trends in the IT sector and collective labour agreement wage developments to remain competitive.

The calculated increase is adjusted based on how long you have been employed during the relevant year (seniority). To keep things fair for everyone, in your first year we take into account how long you have been working with us.

- **Pro-rata increase:** If you started later in the year, any salary increase is calculated proportionally to the number of months you have been employed. Someone who has contributed for 12 months receives a larger share of the increase than someone who has contributed for 4 months.

- **Start in Q4:** If you started in October, November or December, you will not be eligible for a salary increase at the next turn of the year. We have not had enough time to properly assess your performance, and you are likely still in your induction period. All colleagues do, however, participate in the Huddle Elevator to gain experience with this assessment model.

## Step 3: Banding

These scores are validated across the Huddles to form a fair picture. Here, we look not only at the numbers but especially at the story behind them. We filter out subjectivity as much as possible to arrive at an objective performance score.

Finally, we line up all the new salaries. Does the distribution feel logical? Is the ratio between juniors, mediors and seniors still correct? Do the differences between colleagues with similar impact make sense? Where necessary, we make manual corrections to prevent imbalances.
