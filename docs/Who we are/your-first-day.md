# Welcome to Respellion!

 

We have collected some useful information for you to start with. In the first few days, we also plan a few appointments in your calendar.

You can start with the following activities:

 

- Check the onboarding checklist on SharePoint and filter on name
- View our SharePoint environments
- Read through the Employee Handbook
- If you work on internal activities, you turn them into an activity on the Respellion Taskboard
- Write a short profile text for the Respellion website (see examples)
- Create your personal plan on the Miro board

 

Here are a few topics for the first few weeks that we will discuss together:

- Introduction presentations:
    - Respellion Introduction.pptx
    - Respellion Holacracy
    - Coaching Culture
- Check the current organizational model on [Glassfrogg](https://app.glassfrog.com/organizations/32697/orgnav/roles/13886133)

All the necessary information is available via our employee handbook or the internal docs.
