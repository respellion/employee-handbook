# The Respellion model; no management, no job descriptions

## Core Principles

Holacracy is a governance framework that enables self-organization without traditional management hierarchies. At Respellion, we've adopted this approach to align with our core values:

 
- Trust
- Courage
- Self-discipline
- Entrepreneurship

## Why Holacracy?

Our observations from the field show that while agile frameworks effectively facilitate self-organization in teams, organizational structures often remain rigid. Holacracy addresses this by:

 

- Transforming static job descriptions into dynamic roles
- Shifting from delegated authority to distributed authority
- Replacing large reorganizations with constant micro-iterations
- Substituting office politics with transparent rules and disciplined processes

## Key Elements

  1. **Role-Based Structure:** Individuals fill one or more clearly defined roles within the organization, each with specific accountabilities.
  2. **Circle Organization:** Related roles form circles that are connected through link roles.
  3. **Dynamic Governance:** Roles are defined, amended, or removed through a formal governance process.
  4. **Meeting Formats:** Structured meetings focused on action rather than over-analysis.
  5. **Tension-Driven Evolution:** The organization evolves through addressing "tensions" - gaps between what is and what could be.

## Practical Implementation

Respellion operates with:

- One organizational circle
- Monthly tactical and governance meetings (Fridays)
- A Huddle check-in meetings per week
- A Huddle Elevator session each two months
- A task board for tracking work
- Microsoft Loop for administration and meeting notes  


## Meeting Structure
All meetings are administered in Microsoft Loop

### Tactical Meetings

- Focus on operational issues and coordinating next actions
- Results in clear tasks assigned to specific roles
- Tasks are tracked on the Respellion Task Board

### Governance Meetings

- Focus on evolving the organizational structure
- Create, modify, or remove roles based on emerging needs
- Follow a structured process to address tensions through role changes
- Meeting notes are administered on Governance Meeting Notes

## The Concept of Tension

A tension represents an opportunity for improvement—a gap between current reality and potential. Tensions can be resolved by:

- Providing information
- Creating new roles
- Defining specific actions
   

This approach empowers our people with real responsibility, entrepreneurial freedom, and the ability to evolve our organization continuously.
