# Your Pension

At Respellion, we believe it is important to take good care of each other, not just today, but also with an eye toward the future. That is why we have established a pension scheme with **a.s.r. Doen Pensioen**, supported by advice from **Zuyderleven**.

Below, we explain how your pension is structured.

## 1. The Basis: Defined Contribution Scheme

We utilize a Defined Contribution scheme (beschikbare premieregeling). This means that a fixed amount is invested every month for your future pension pot.

- Pension Provider: a.s.r. Doen Pensioen.
- Contribution (Premium): 10% of your pensionable salary (pension base) is contributed.
- Employee Contribution: Based on our calculation models, we apply a split where you as the employee contribute 50% of this premium, and Respellion contributes the remaining 50%.

## 2. How is the contribution calculated?

You do not build up a pension over your entire salary because you will also receive AOW (state pension) from the government later in life. The portion of your salary over which you do build up a pension is called the pension base (pensioengrondslag).

- **Franchise** (Threshold): This is the part of your salary over which you do not build up a pension. For 2026, this is set at **€19,172.00**.
- **Maximum Salary**: Pension is built up on salary up to a maximum of **€137,800.00**.
- Calculation Example: Salary: €69,172
  - Franchise: - €19,172
  - Pension Base: €50,000
  - Total Annual Contribution (10%): €5,000

## 3. Investing via Life Cycles

Your pension funds are invested. Since your retirement date may still be far off, the risk is automatically reduced as you get older. We call this a Life Cycle.

- **Standard**: You usually start in a specific profile (e.g., Neutral), but you have the freedom to choose between different risk profiles: Defensive, Neutral, or Offensive.
- **Phasing out**: As you get closer to your retirement date, investments are shifted to safer options to minimize volatility and protect your capital.

## 4. Provisions for Death and Illness

In addition to saving for later, insurance is built-in for unforeseen situations.

- **Partner's Pension**: In the event of your death, your partner will receive a benefit of 30% of your salary (for life).
    Note: This is on a risk basis, meaning coverage lapses if you leave Respellion's employment.
- **Orphan's Pension**: Children receive 20% of your salary until they reach the age of 25.
- **ANW Gap Insurance**: You can voluntarily (at your own expense) take out extra insurance to provide a temporary supplement for your partner after death.
- **Disability**: In the event of disability (AO), your pension accrual continues (partially or fully) without you paying premiums (waiver of premium).

## 5. Flexibility and Insight

You have direct influence over your own pension:
- **Extra Savings**: If you want to build up more pension, you may voluntarily make additional contributions up to the fiscal maximum.
- **Portal**: Through the 'Doen Pensioen' dashboard, you have 24/7 insight into your current accrual, returns, and the ability to submit your preferences.
